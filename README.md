## About the Project

Obscura introduces a novel approach to explainability, addressing key gaps in existing methodologies. It is built to:

- **Deliver Contextual Explanations**: Generate explanations tailored to the specific context of predictions for actionable insights.
- **Provide Hierarchical Interpretability**: Reveal relationships between features, not just their individual contributions.
- **Handle Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Offer intuitive interpretations of complex, high-dimensional datasets.
- **Customize Explanation Techniques**: Adapt to diverse models and application domains for maximum flexibility.
- **Support Bias Detection**: Identify and address potential biases in machine learning models.
